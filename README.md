# Genetic Algorithm Optimization for CIFAR-10 using CNN

This repository contains an operational research project focused on optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset using a genetic algorithm. The project explores the application of genetic algorithms to find the optimal hyperparameters and architecture for a CNN to improve its performance on the CIFAR-10 image classification task.
## Introduction
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This project leverages a genetic algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters and architecture of a CNN to enhance its classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow keras scikit-learn matplotlib
